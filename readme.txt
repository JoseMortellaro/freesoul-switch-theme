Freesoul Switch Themes allows you to load multiple themes on the same WordPress website.

== Description ==

Freesoul Switch Themes allows you to load multiple themes on the same WordPress website.

You can assign a different theme in a permanent way, or just see a preview of a specific page or post with a different theme.

You will find a section on the edit page screen.

Having a theme preview while the website is public is useful when you are trying to understand if the actual theme is causing an issue on the front-end.

Assigning a different theme on specific pages may be useful when you want a different style only on some pages.

The actual version supports only the front-end and no custom post types.




== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `freesoul-switch-theme` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. You will find the plugin options in each single page and post and a global settings page under the plugins admin menu
4. All done. Good job!
